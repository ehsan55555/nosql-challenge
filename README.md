# nosql-challenge

# Overview

## This repository contains code and instructions for analyzing UK food establishment data using NoSQL techniques, specifically MongoDB. 
        The data is sourced from a real-world dataset and involves tasks such as data loading, exploration, filtering, aggregation, and visualization. 
        The primary goal of this challenge is to demonstrate proficiency in working with NoSQL databases, Python, and data analysis using real-world data.


## Repository Structure

# Challenge Deliverables

## Deliverable 1: Data Import and Database Setup

        The "Deliverable_1_Starter_Code.ipynb" notebook contains code that accomplishes the following tasks:

        Imports the raw data from the "establishments.json" file.
        Sets up and updates the "uk_food" MongoDB database with the imported data.

## Deliverable 2: Exploratory Analysis Queries
        The "Deliverable_2_Starter_Code.ipynb" notebook contains code that performs exploratory analysis queries on the "uk_food" MongoDB database. This includes tasks such as data exploration, filtering, aggregation, and visualization.
